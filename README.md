Matlab code from five different home assignments.
lab1 and lab2 are simple repition assignments from previous matcourses, alot of time are spent understanding the basics of matrices.

HA1 contains code solving and/or understanding: Vectors, PLots, Functions, Scripts, Loops and conditionals, Nested loops, Heat flow, Gaussiam elimination, Interpolation(both splines and polynomials, with uncertainties), Signal processing, detection of outliers and Extrapolation.

HA2 contains code solving and/or understanding: Taylor expantion, Derivatives, Integrals, Double integrals over rectangles and general areas(triangulation and summation over triangles), Newton-Rhapsons method, Newton-Raphson in several dimention, ODE, systems of ODE, Higher order ODE, Numerical methods for differential equations, Boundary value problems.

HA3 contains code solving and/or understanding: Oscillations, Particle in potential, Random number generation, estimation of integral with random, Estimating definite integrals.

This course gave me a great basic understanding of how to use matlab.
